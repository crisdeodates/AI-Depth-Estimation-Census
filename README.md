# Depth-Estimation-Census
This project was developed during my university Image Processing classes. Given 2 images featuring the same space seen from 2 different perspectives, the application can determine the depth of the image using the Census transform. In order to improve the accuracy of the method, the result is filtered using a median filter to eliminate any salt and pepper noise. This method gives an error rate of about 17%.

For more information and a complete explanation of the methods used please check the [documentation](https://github.com/radusocaci/Depth-Estimation-Census/blob/master/DEPTH%20ESTIMATION%20FROM%20STEREO%20IMEGES%20USING%20CENSUS%20TRANSFORM.pptx).
